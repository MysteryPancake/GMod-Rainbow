# Garry's Mod Rainbow Functions
These are a bunch of functions I've made to assist people with drawing rainbow stuff in [Garry's Mod](http://www.garrysmod.com/). Most of them involve the [surface library](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Category:surface), and cause a lot of lag.

Use them for whatever you want, and have fun!
